# Enhanced-KMV-model

## Overview
This project extends the traditional KMV credit risk model by incorporating modern techniques to improve the prediction of future asset values and the estimation of default probabilities. By integrating Monte Carlo simulations, machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble methods, this enhanced model provides a more accurate and dynamic tool for credit risk assessment.

## Features
- Monte Carlo Simulations: Simulate future asset value paths under various market conditions to provide a comprehensive view of potential scenarios.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Use historical data and advanced statistical methods to predict future asset values more accurately.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Classify firms into default and non-default categories based on financial metrics and market conditions, improving Distance to Default (DD) calculations.
- Ensemble Methods: Enhance the robustness of Probability of Default (PD) predictions by combining multiple models to mitigate individual biases and improve overall performance.
